LF Tools is a collection of scripts and utilities that are useful to multiple
Linux Foundation project CI and Releng related activities. We try to create
these tools to be as generic as possible such that they can be deployed in
other environments.

Ubuntu Dependencies:

    - build-essentials
    - python-dev
