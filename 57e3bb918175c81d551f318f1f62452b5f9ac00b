If the user passes a pom file then there\u0027s no point passing a group_id.\n\nWe can make the usage statement print that if -f is passed then group_id is not needed however if -f is not passed then group_id needs to be passed at the very least.",

      "message": "Anil, From your previous comment, what\u0027s your recommendation on how to handle this?\n\nAlso wondering if parsing from the filename below makes sense either. I suspect not all RPMs generated by projects will include correctly formatted filename structures but at least we have an override by manually passing the optional parameters. Does this make sense or should we do things differently?",
