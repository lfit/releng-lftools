They are forced into releasing org.bar.foo.foo\n\nSo, instead of removing the second target, perhaps it should be rewritten as\n\ntarget1 \u003d \u0027/%s\u0027 % groupId.replace(\u0027.\u0027, \u0027[/\\.]\u0027)",

      "message": "hmm... I thought this was what we agreed to the past meeting. So I guess the constraint is a project wants to publish things to both.\n\n org.opendaylight.PROJECT/maven/artifacts/go/here\n\nas well as \n\n org.opendaylight.PROJECT.ADDITIONAL.ARTIFACTS/\n\nIf we want to simplify this then the regex might look like:\n\n \u0027^/%s.*\u0027 % groupId.replace(\u0027.\u0027, \u0027[/\\.]\u0027)\n\n(basically remove the end /)\n\nOr stay with having the 2 regex patterns.\n\nI think we shouldn\u0027t allow the 2nd case because it basically gives them a wildcard namespace as long as it loosely starts with the groupId.\n\nFor example the 2 projects in OpenDaylight, DLUX and DLUXAPPs. DLUX can write into the DLUX apps namespace because it starts with DLUX.",
