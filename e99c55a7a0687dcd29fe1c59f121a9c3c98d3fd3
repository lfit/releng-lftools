      "message": "This seems like a big jump, from 0.5 seconds to 60. Is there a reason for increasing the wait 120x?\n\nAlso, to unit test functions that include a sleep without actually waiting, you can patch the sleep function to no-op. See my change here: https://gerrit.linuxfoundation.org/infra/c/releng/lftools/+/69720/3/tests/test_nexus.py",

      "message": "Ah, true, Ok, I will add some unit tests for it.\nI started with 1 second, but it retried so many times until it failed\nWent to 15 seconds and it has a number of retries.\nAt 30 or so, just a few retries, so decided to play it safe and went with 60.\nThis delay is only when the error 429 appears, so when I tested it only waits about 2 times. The previous fix I had waited 0.5 seconds after every get. Thjis worked fine for 5 days at my laptop, until the other day :(\nDon\u0027t know what treshhold dockerhub has for normal get access, the only throttling thing I found was in regards to pull\u0027s, which is what I originally thought caused my issues.",
