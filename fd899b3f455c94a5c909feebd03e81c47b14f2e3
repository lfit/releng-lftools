It was the docker module whose URLs the requests library was not parsing correctly. Wehn I researched this, one of the suggested fixes was rather than downgrade requests, upgrade the docker module. We also inadvertently introduced a security issue, since requests \u003c2.32.0 has known security problems, but since we weren\u0027t auditing our changes in CI/CD pipeline this is easy to miss.",
