(Although I\u0027m not sure we want to allow infinity in case we run into a weird case where infinite is an infinite loop (think symlinked directories wrapping back to the top level)).\n\nWhat\u0027s a reasonable depth that we need to support? In ODL\u0027s case the default of 5 was enough but seems like ONAP might need more. How deep is the deepest directories ONAP has in it\u0027s project?",
