lftools v0.10.0 Release Notes
=============================

Thanks to Andy, Anil, Ry, and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Notable changes since v0.9.0
----------------------------

d943695 Andrew Grimberg Re-order log ENV stripping and add new key
Added additional env stripping for more variables that should not be logged.

9a42505 Ry Jones        Update setuptools version to 36.5.0
Some CI systems were having issues installing lftools and needed a version of
setuptools>=30 so we bumped the setuptools version in requirements.txt

1b6e57e Thanh Ha        Make OpenStack requirements optional
OpenStack requirements are now optional and must be installed via
`pip install lftools[openstack]` if they are needed. This should hopefully cut
down on the amount of dependencies installed for lftools usage in most CI jobs.
