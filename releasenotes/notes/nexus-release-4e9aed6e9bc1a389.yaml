   Remove drop of staging repos on release
   The api returns that the relese is completed.
   in the background java threads are still running.
   Then we call drop and nexus has threads promoting and dropping
   at the same time.
   In this way we lose data.
   Something else needs to drop, the api does not correctly
   handle this.
