    Support log shipping logs to AWS S3 buckets.

    A conditional statement is provided so that when a
    s3 bucket name is provided, it checks to see if that
    bucket exists, and if it exists, uploads the logs.
    If the bucket does not exist, it will create  a new
    bucket, apply public read permissions, apply a 181
    days object lifecycle policy and set up the bucket
    as a static website then upload logs.
