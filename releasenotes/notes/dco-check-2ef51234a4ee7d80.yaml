features:
  - |
    DCO check is now purely in Python, and the 'dco' shell script is removed.
    A '--strict' option is added that, when used, checks not only for the 
    existence of a DCO signature in a commit message, but that the email in the
    signature matches the email of the commit author.
deprecations:
  - |
    The DCO shell script has been removed. This is a transparent change as the
    dco check method invokation has not changed.
