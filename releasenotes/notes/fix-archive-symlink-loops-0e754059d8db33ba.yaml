    Change the copy_archives method used by deploy_archives to use copy2 with
    follow_symlinks set to False, which will copy symlinks as symlinks, rather
    than following their path. Since glob does not have an option to not follow
    symlinks, we instead just check for file existence to ignore issues with
    globbing symlinked paths that "open" fails to find.
