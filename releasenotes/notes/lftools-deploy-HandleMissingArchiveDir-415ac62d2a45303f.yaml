    Fixes an OSError exception that is not handled, in the lftools command:

    lftools deploy archives

    The code resides in the copy_archives function in deploy.py file.

    This exception is caused by a missing archives directory, which a for loop
    expects to be there.
    The fix is simply to verify if archives file/directory exists, and if it does
    then perform the for loop.

    12:07:36   File "/home/jenkins/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lftools/deploy.py", line 166, in copy_archives
    12:07:36     for file_or_dir in os.listdir(archives_dir):
    12:07:36 OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/w/workspace/music-mdbc-master-verify-java/archives'
