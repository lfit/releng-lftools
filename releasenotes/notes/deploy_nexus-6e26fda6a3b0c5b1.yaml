fixes:
  - |
    Refactored deploy_nexus to use concurrent.futures rather than multiprocessing.
    This allows for non-blocking I/O, and also allows for easy state tracking.
    It should also fix any random failures that are hard to troubleshoot.
features:
  - |
    Added a get_filesize method to calculate filesize is an appropriate format.
    This may be useful in logs if an upload fails.
