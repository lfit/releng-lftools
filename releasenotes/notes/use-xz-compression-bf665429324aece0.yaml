upgrade:
  - |
    Use lzma (.xz) which is faster and a better compression algorithm as
    compared to using gzip (.gz). This ensures that Nexus logs uploaded have a
    smaller foot print.
fixes:
  - |
    Add file extensions *.html and *.xml ensure they are compressed. *.xml files
    can be quite large on log server and this ensures that Nexus has a smaller
    foot print.
