features:
  - |
    Refactored deploy_maven_file() function from shell/deploy to pure Python to
    be more portable with Windows systems.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``deploy maven-file`` command no longer calls maven (relying instead on
    a direct REST call to Nexus). Due to this change, the following options
    have been removed:

    * ``-b|--maven-bin``
    * ``-gs|--global-settings``
    * ``-s|--settings``
    * ``-p|--maven-params``

    Any calls to this command should be updated. Nexus credentials should be
    located in the local .netrc file.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``shell/deploy`` script's deploy_maven_file() function is now deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release.
