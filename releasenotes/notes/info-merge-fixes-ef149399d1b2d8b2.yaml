fixes:
  - |
    Correct the file path for the JJB info file job. This was incorrectly set as
    an absolute path, but it needs to be relative to the git repo root.
  - |
    Add the "safe" parameter to URL parsing in create_project. This removes the
    default safe value which includes the forward slash. In this case, we do
    want to escape slashes that are part of the repo name.
