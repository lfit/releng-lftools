prelude: >
    Changes to lftools needed for project creation to happen
    via command line logic.
features:
  - |
    lftools gerrit createproject
    lftools gerrit prepareproject
    lftools gerrit addinfojob
    lftools gerrit addinfofile
issues:
  - |
    Addinfofile trips up on extended characters in usernames.
    Project lead must be added by hand to lftools infofile create.
upgrade:
  - |
    lftools.ini needs configuration on internal jenkins for auth.
    Documenting and implementing this is an internal endevor and beyond
    the scope of these release notes.
fixes:
  - |
    Use proper python3 config parser.
    Add has_section check for configparser
    lftools github update repo will properly return "repo not found"
    lftools infofile create will now take tsc approval string and set date.
    lftools infofile will allow INFO.yaml to be created before ldap group.
    yaml4info now correclty outputs to STDOUT so that its output can be properly
    captured and printed by python.
    lfidapi now correctly exits if a group does not exist.
