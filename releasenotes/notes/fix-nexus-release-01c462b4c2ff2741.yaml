    nexus.release_staging_repos was failing with an error due to an undeclared
    variable. Upon inspection, there were several other issues at play as well:
    * No unit test (which would have caught an undeclared variable).
    * Initial sleep of 20s is significantly longer than many repos take to
    release.
    * Only checked release status every 40s, while printing every 20s.
    * Rather than checking release status, we were checking for "close"
    status. Nexus closes repos before releasing them, so this is not the
    correct status to look for when waiting for the repo to release.

    A unit test has been added, several variables issues have been corrected,
    timing was adjusted (waiting just 5 seconds before the initial check for
    success), and the code will now check for "release" status.
