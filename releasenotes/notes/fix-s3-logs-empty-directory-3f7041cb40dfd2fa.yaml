    Create an temp file for logs shipping with AWS S3 Buckets.

    Since S3 buckets does not have an underlying file system, to view empty
    directories, an temp file has to be created when referencing the directory.
    This allows empty folders to be viewed through cloudfront, without which
    a 404 error is returned.
