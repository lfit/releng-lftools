    Fix OSError in lftools deploy archives due to pattern

    If the pattern is not properly done, the resulting file list might
    contain duplicated files.

    This fix will remove the duplicated patterns, as well as the
    duplicated matched files.

    This fix should fix the following crash
    08:24:05   File "/home/jenkins/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lftools/deploy.py", line 204, in copy_archives
    08:24:05     os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(dest))
    08:24:05   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/os.py", line 157, in makedirs
    08:24:05     mkdir(name, mode)
    08:24:05 OSError: [Errno 17] File exists: '/tmp/lftools-da.m80YHz/features/benchmark/odl-benchmark-api/target/surefire-reports'
