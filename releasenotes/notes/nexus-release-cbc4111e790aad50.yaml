    Add Nexus command to release one or more staging repositories. Via the
    Nexus 2 REST API, this command performs both a "release" and a "drop"
    action on the repo(s), in order to best reproduce the action of manually
    using the "Release" option in the Nexus UI.

    Usage: lftools nexus release [OPTIONS] [REPOS]...

    Options:
      -s, --server TEXT  Nexus server URL. Can also be set as NEXUS_URL in the
                         environment. This will override any URL set in
                         settings.yaml.
