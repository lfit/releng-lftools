    Fix ValueError in match-ldap-to-info when lfservices_releng missing.

    The code unconditionally tried to remove 'lfservices_releng' from
    the user list, causing a ValueError when it doesn't exist in the
    LDAP group (common in production environments).

    This was causing info-merge-master jobs to fail.

    Now checks if the user exists before attempting removal.
