    This function will collect all tags from both nexus and docker, for
    a particular org (default 'onap'), as well as a repo (default all repos).
    With this information, it will calculate a list of valid tags that needs to
    be copied to docker from Nexus.
    Usage:
      lftools nexus docker nexus2docker
    Options:
      -o, --org TEXT   Specify repository organisation. Default "onap".
      -r, --repo TEXT  Only repos containing this string will be selected.
                       Default set to blank string, which is every repo
      -s, --summary    Prints a summary of missing docker tags.
      -v, --verbose    Prints all collected repo/tag information.
      -c, --copy       Copy missing tags from Nexus repos to Docker repos.

    Currently, if the docker repo is missing, it is not created specifically,
    but implicitly by docker itself when we push the docker image to an non-
    existing docker repo. The Public flag should be set properly, but

    Before you give the "lftools nexus docker nexus2docker" command please
    ensure you have manually logged in to both Nexus as well as to Docker.

    sudo docker login       ---> DOCKER Credentials
    sudo docker login nexus3.onap.org:10002 -u <yourLFID>
